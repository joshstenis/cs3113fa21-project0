Build Instructions:
 - open repository as pwd in terminal
 - IF a project0 binary file already exists, type into the terminal `make clean`
 - Type into the terminal `make`, `make all`, or `make project0`.
 - To run the project0 program, type into the terminal `cat <filename> | ./project0`. The piping of <filename> is to populate stdin. If there is another way you
 wish to populate stdin go ahead and use that method.
